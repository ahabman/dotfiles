Something to Add?
-----------------

If you have suggestions or things to add then send a pull request. If I like
it then I will merge them (Color schemes are a subjective thing).

**NOTE: If you're going to send a pull request that you want me to merge,
please post a comment in it with before/after screenshots!**

Screenshots
-----------

These are some screenshots of the theme but they might no be the most up to 
date (will try my best). Even though they might not be the most up to date
they will give you a good idea of what it is about. (NOTE: Some of these
screen shots were taken on different environments and the fonts are different.
Revolution does not change the font that you set.)
